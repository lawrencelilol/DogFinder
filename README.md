# DogFinder

I used this project to practice :servlet programming, web scraping, API's, JSON, and MVC. It also gives cute dogs more web exposure.

The program presents a welcome screen containing a title, my name, and a drop-down menu of a limited number of dog breeds, as in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 

The Submit button is used to record the user's choice.

Figure 3 and Figure 4  shows the output screen. Several facts have been scraped from the web site:

These facts include the star ratings for friendliness and intelligence, the height and weight ranges of the breed, and the expected lifespan. All of these are  scraped.

Next, a picture of a representative of the breed is shown. This is retrieved from a different site:

https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

using that site's API.
